        <h1 class='title'>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Pathfinder 2e Framework! Based on the most excellent work of the PF2e Foundry Developers!</p>
        <p><b>Important</b>: You and all players must enable External Macro Access via "Edit -> Preferences -> Application Tab -> Macro Permissions Section -> Enable External Macro Access"</p>
        <h2 class='title'>GM Setup</h2>
        <p>Spawned on the starting map are two tokens named "GM Macros", and "Campaign Macros" - these contain a number of macros intended for the GM and Campaign panels. Select each token and then drag the macros across.</p>
        <h2 class='title'>Player Characters</h2>
        <p>Adding Player Characters is currently only possible via import from Pathbuilder - via the link in the Compendium. When imported, a PC Lib token will be placed on the "Player Characters" map. This token stores all data for the player token, but can be freely viewed and reimported via the compendium links. Player should be able to import their own PC themselves, and the resulting token should have ownership set as expected. The one thing to note about token imports from Pathbuilder: Some "Features" according to Pathbuilder aren&#39;t "Features" in Foundry&#39;s data set. You&#39;ll get a warning when importing a character - any class features, or custom content is fine to ignore.</p>
        <p>To spawn the PC Party on another map, for use in an encounter, make use of the GM Macro "Spawn PC Party" which will spawn interactable tokens for each PC.</p>
